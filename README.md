We use decision tree model and random forest model to mine KDD-99 data. The data set is 9 weeks of network connection data collected from a simulated US Air Force LAN, divided into marked train data and test data. The test data and training data have different probability distributions. The test data contains some types of attacks that do not appear in the training data, which makes intrusion detection more realistic. Because the two samples are too large, this article only uses the classic 10% training data for training, and uses all the test data for testing. The mining process of this article is mainly divided into the following parts: data loading, data cleaning, model building, model training and prediction, and result evaluation. In the end, both models achieved very impressive results, with an overall accuracy rate of 91%.
